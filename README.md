The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify athletes into risk of being
injured or non-injured categories based on their blood composition and other available to hand health indicator datas. By leveraging machine learning 
algorithms, we aim to create a reliable tool that physios can use to assist in assessing the players in day to day operations to keep the athletes healthy and fit and free from foreseeable injuries.
